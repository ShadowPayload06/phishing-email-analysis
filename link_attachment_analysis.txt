Suspicious Link and Attachment Analysis

Objective:
To identify potentially malicious links or attachments embedded in the phishing email sample.

Sample Used:
- Title: “You Have Received A New Payment”
- Source: CanIPhish – Phishing Email Examples
- Spoofed Brand: Payoneer

Findings:
- The email contains a hyperlink labeled “View Payment” which redirects to `http://businesses.loan/paynow`. 
  This domain is unrelated to Payoneer and uses a suspicious `.loan` top-level domain (TLD), often associated with phishing campaigns.
- The display text of the link attempts to mimic a legitimate action, but the actual URL leads to a deceptive domain.
- No attachments were present in the sample. However, phishing emails commonly include files such as `invoice.zip`, `payment.html`, or `document.scr` 
  which may contain malware or redirect to credential harvesting pages.

Tools Used:
- CheckPhish.ai — to scan the suspicious URL for phishing indicators.
- VirusTotal — to simulate how a file or link would be analyzed for malware and threat signatures.

How to Use VirusTotal:
1. Visit [https://www.virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com)
2. Choose either:
   - **URL tab** to scan a suspicious link
   - **File tab** to upload a suspicious attachment
3. Paste the URL or upload the file
4. Click **Search** or **Upload and analyze**
5. Review the results:
   - VirusTotal aggregates results from 70+ antivirus engines
   - Look for red flags like “Phishing”, “Malware”, or “Suspicious behavior”

Screenshot:
No screenshots were included in this task. The analysis was conducted using publicly available tools and simulated phishing content for educational purposes.

Conclusion:
The link embedded in the email is deceptive and leads to a domain not affiliated with Payoneer. This is a common tactic used in phishing campaigns to trick users into revealing sensitive information. 
The absence of attachments in this sample does not eliminate risk, as the embedded link itself is a threat vector.

Note:
This analysis highlights the importance of inspecting both visible and hidden elements of an email. 
Suspicious links and misleading domains are key indicators of phishing attempts. 
Tools like VirusTotal help validate threats without exposing the user to risk.
