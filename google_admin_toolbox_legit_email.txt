Task 3: Email Header Analysis Using Google Admin Toolbox

Objective:
To demonstrate the use of Google Admin Toolbox Message Header Analyzer for inspecting the header of a legitimate email.

Tool Used:
Google Admin Toolbox – Message Header Analyzer  
Link: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/

Email Source:
A legitimate email received from Google confirming account activity.  
Sender: noreply@google.com

Steps Followed:
1. Opened the email in Gmail.
2. Clicked the three-dot menu (⋮) next to the reply button.
3. Selected “Show original” to view the full email header.
4. Copied the entire header text.
5. Pasted the header into Google Admin Toolbox Message Header Analyzer.

Results:
- SPF: Pass with IP 209.85.220.69 — The sending IP is authorized by Google’s SPF policy.
- DKIM: Pass with domain google.com — The message was digitally signed and verified.
- DMARC: Result field present — Indicates that Google enforces domain-level authentication policies.

Screenshot:
A screenshot of the tool’s output has been added to the following folder for reference:  
`phishing-email-analysis-task2/screenshots/`  
File name: `google_admin_toolbox_google_email.png`

Conclusion:
The email passed all authentication checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and was routed through trusted servers. This confirms the legitimacy of the sender and the integrity of the message.

Note:
This is how a legitimate email appears when scanned using Google Admin Toolbox.
The presence of valid SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results — along with trusted relay paths — helps confirm authenticity and protects against spoofing.
This analysis serves as a baseline for comparing suspicious or phishing emails in future tasks.
