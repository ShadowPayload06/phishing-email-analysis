Examine Sender's Email Address for Spoofing

Objective:
Analyze the sender’s email address in the phishing sample to identify signs of spoofing or impersonation.

Sample Used:
- Title: “You Have Received A New Payment”
- Source: CanIPhish – Phishing Email Examples
- Spoofed Brand: Payoneer

Sender Details:
- Display Name: Payoneer
- Email Address: open@businesses.loan
- Domain: spearingservice.services.loan

Analysis:
1. Domain Mismatch:
   The sender domain (.loan) does not match Payoneer’s official domain (@payoneer.com). This is a strong indicator of spoofing.

2. Unusual TLD:
   The top-level domain (.loan) is rarely used by legitimate financial services and is commonly exploited in phishing campaigns.

3. Generic Local Part:
   The local part of the email (open@) is vague and not tied to any known department (e.g., support@payoneer.com).

Conclusion:
The sender address is clearly spoofed. It uses a misleading domain and generic structure to impersonate Payoneer and trick recipients into trusting the message.
