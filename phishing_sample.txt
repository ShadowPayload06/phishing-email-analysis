- Location: /screenshots/ folder in GitHub repository

Description
This phishing simulation mimics a Payoneer payment notification. It includes:
- A spoofed sender address (`open@businesses.loan`)
- A fake payment amount of $970.00
- A message urging the recipient to verify their account within 24 hours
- A suspicious link disguised as a Payoneer gateway

Reason for Selection
This sample demonstrates key phishing tactics:
- Brand impersonation
- Urgency and manipulation
- Spoofed domain and sender
- Suspicious link embedded in a financial context

This makes it ideal for analyzing phishing indicators in Task 2.
