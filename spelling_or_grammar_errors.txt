Verify Presence of Spelling or Grammar Errors

Objective:
To check for spelling or grammar inconsistencies in the phishing email that may indicate lack of professionalism or automated generation.

Observation:
The phishing email is mostly well-written, but contains subtle grammar issues:
- The sentence “You have received a new payment to your Global Payment Service!” is awkwardly phrased. A more natural version would be: “You have received a new payment through your Global Payment Service account.”
- The phrase “If clicking Verify fails, please click the link below:” is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural and robotic. A legitimate email would likely say: “If the verification link doesn’t work, please use the alternate link below.”

Analysis:
While there are no outright spelling mistakes, the phrasing and sentence structure suggest the email may have been auto-generated or written by a non-native speaker. These subtle cues help distinguish phishing attempts from professionally crafted emails.

Conclusion:
Even without spelling errors, unnatural grammar and robotic phrasing are red flags. Users should be trained to notice awkward language as part of phishing awareness.
