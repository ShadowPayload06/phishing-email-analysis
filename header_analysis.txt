Email Header Analysis

Objective:
To inspect the email headers for signs of spoofing, failed authentication, or suspicious routing as part of phishing email analysis.

Sample Used:
- Title: “You Have Received A New Payment”
- Source: CanIPhish – Phishing Email Examples
- Spoofed Brand: Payoneer

Method:
Since the sample is a simulation and does not include real header data, a mock header was constructed to simulate analysis using MXToolbox.

Mock Header:
Return-Path: <open@businesses.loan>
Received: from unknownserver.loan (192.168.1.100)
Authentication-Results: spf=fail dkim=none dmarc=none

Findings:
- SPF: Failed — the domain `businesses.loan` is not authorized to send on behalf of Payoneer.
- DKIM: Missing — no digital signature found to verify sender authenticity.
- DMARC: None — the domain has no policy to prevent spoofing.
- Relay Path: Routed through unknown mail servers, not matching Payoneer’s infrastructure.

Conclusion:
The email header shows clear signs of spoofing and lack of authentication. These discrepancies confirm the sender is not legitimate and the email is likely part of a phishing campaign.
